Hi, my data project explores the relationship between weather trends and birth rates.

(next)

My project contains datasets on: Temperature and birth rates in NSW, C02 Levels, Fertility Rates and google search trends in Australia between 1990 and 2019.

(next)

I set the goal of answering the questions:
Does weather affect births?
Which type of weather is more popular for making babies? and 
Has climate change affected births?

(next)

I began by pinpointing the highest and lowest values for Temperature and rainfall to compare them with NSW birth rates 9 months later to see if there was any correlation.

(next)

Here Is the hottest month, January 2017 which is 10% higher than January’s average, and the coldest July 1998, which is 9.5% lower than the month avg.

(next)
(pause)

October 2017, 9 months after the hottest month had a decreased birth rate of 0.4%.

(next)
(pause)

And, April 1999, 9 months after the coldest month had a decreased birth rate of 3%.

(next)
(pause)

Here is the Wettest month February 1990 359% higher than the month average and the driest August 1995, which had no rainfall.

(next)
(pause)

December 1990, 9 months after the wettest month had a decreased birth rate of 0.4%.

(next)
(pause)

And, May 1996, 9 months after the driest month had an increased birth rate of 4%.

**graph read**
I then found the months with the highest and lowest birth rates and compared the weather trends 9 months prior at conception. 

(next)

October 2012 had the highest amount of births being 10% higher than the avg.

(next)

And, December 2019 had the lowest being 62% lower than the avg. 

(next)
(pause)

9 months prior of October 2012, January 2012 had a decreased temperature of 2.9%  

(next) 
(pause)

And, 9 moths prior of December 2019, March 2019 had an increased temperature of 4.6%.

(next)
(pause)

January 2012, also had an increased rainfall of 51%

(next)
(pause)

And, March 2019, had an increased rainfall of 95%.

(next)

Here are some scatter plots showing the dispersion of temperature and rainfall paired with the birth rates 9 months later.

(next)
(pause)

So Far, you can see that warmer weather had less births 9 months later, colder weather had increased births, wetter weather had less births and drier weather had increased births.

(next)

I then charted my data over time to look for trends. 

(next)

You can see here that as the temperature decreased, the number of births increased.

(next)
(pause)

And for the rainfall, As it increased there was a decrease in births.

(next)

Finally, I explored the relationship between climate change effects and fertility rates.

(next)

Here you can see the relationship between Australian C02 levels and NSW Temperature.

(next)
(pause)

In the comparison between NSW fertility rates and NSW Temperature we can see spikes in fertility rates while Temperature Drops. 

(next)

My final graph shows Australian fertility rates paired with Google search trends for “climate change”. To see if any anxiety relating to climate change was affecting fertility.

(next)

As climate change searches spiked in 2009 Australian fertility rates began to drop.

(next)

 So, we can see weather has some affect on births, with cold and dry conditions being the best for making babies and, 

(next)

Both climate change and the ecological anxiety paired with it has a negative affect on human fertility.

Thank you
